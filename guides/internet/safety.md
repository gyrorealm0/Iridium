# Internet Safety
The Basics of internet safety come down to two things, paying attention, and paying attention.  

The only way for your computer to become infected with a malicious software is if you let it into your computer, thats just how it is. There are some preventitive steps you can take to protect yourself, but the best protection is staying aware, and doubting everything.

## Email
Email is the most common way for your computer to become infected, because people tend to forget that anyone from anywhere can send them an email, with anything inside of it. Simply clicking a hyperlink can in seconds; steal all of your personal data, lock you out of your computer, or brick your hardware. Web browsers are very powerful tools and should be treated with care and respect.

Never click on a link inside of an email, UNLESS, you were expecting the email (password reset, account verification, etc), or you have taken all the possible steps (checking for gramatical errors, checking the senders address, fully trusting the sender of the email with all data on your computer, googling the domain of the redirect to make sure the website is legit).  

If you ever have any doubts about why you recieved the email, who its from, or its contents; just delete it and move on. If it is important for you to recieve the information they will send another email. If you are getting spammed with emails from a sender, DO NOT try to find an unsubscribe link; both [google](https://www.google.com/gmail/) and [proton](https://protonmail.com/) have a filtering option to mark emails from a domain as spam, use this instead.
## Surfing
Surfing the web is a great way to learn new information and see all kinds of interesting things, it also happens to be a great way to get your computer infected. Once again, the solution here is to pay attention.  

Before visiting any website, understand the risks involved; total destruction of your computer, and all the information on it, forever.  

If you want a more secure browsing experience there are several steps you can take; using a security focused browser such as [Brave](https://brave.com/), using a [virtual machine](https://www.qemu.org/), and using [linux](https://archlinux.org/).

Even if you are running brave in a linux virtual machine inside of a linux virtual machine inside of linux, there is still some risk involved; while greatly reduced, there is no 100% safe way to browse the internet.
## VPN
A vpn does jackshit to improve the security or privacy of your internet traffic, all it does is direct your requests through the vpn server, meaning you can hide what you are doing from your internet service provider and virtually change your location to access blocked content. There is no security purpose for a vpn, or for privacy, because instead of your isp seeing what you are doing, its the vpn company.
