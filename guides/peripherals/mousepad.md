# Mousepad
The mouse pad is the surface under the mouse, regardless if its just the desk, a piece of paper, or a hardmat; keeping your mousepad as clean and consistent as possible is extremely important in increasing the lifetime of your gliders, and the mousepad itself.  

Gliders are the surfaces on the bottom of the mouse that touch the mousepad; stock, custom, or just the bottom of the mouse itself, the part that touches the mousepad are called the gliders.  

## Desk
Before I get into how to care for and clean each type of mousepad, there are some univeral things that apply to every situation, and should be followed to prolong the lifetime of your setup, and to ease your maintenance.  

Do NOT eat on or near your mousepad or desk, the number one enemy of mousepads, gliders, keyboards, desks, computers, and cleanliness are particles. Food is one of the largest sources of particles in a typical house, making it a priority to keep any food far away from your computer and setup.  

Do NOT allow people to smoke in the building your setup and computer are located. Smoke not only has particles that will dirty your desk and computer, it will break down the plastics inside of your hardware, reducing the lifetime.  

Wash your hands every time before sitting down for a session on the computer. Keeping your hands clean reduces oils from building up in your mouse, on your mousepad, and on your keyboard. Washing of the hands also removes any particles and fibers that might be on them.  

If you have pets, try to keep them out of the room with your setup and computer as much as possible, they are walking piles of fiber and particles; which as you can probably guess by now is what we dont want near the computer.  

Use a coaster for drinks. Water residue will cause rings to form on your desk, depending on the material. Its also a place to set your drink away from your hands to prevent possible spills.
## Deskmats
Deskmats are very simple to clean; place in a shower or bathtub, rinse with water for 2 minutes while scrubbing lightly with a sponge or cloth, then do the same with dish soap or shampoo, NOT handsoap or conditioner, then do the first part again. Lay flat to dry in a dark place.

If you run your fingernail over your deskmat or mousepad and it leaves a trail, that means your mousepad needs to be cleaned. Depending on how clean the environment is you may only need to clean your mousepad once a month, or as much as every few days.
## Hardmats and desks
Wipe it down with a clorox wipe, then dry with paper towel, then rinse with water, then dry with microfiber cloth. To ensure your desk surface is flat, take a piece of paper and writing utencil (crayon works best) lay the paper out over the surface, and color the page. If you see any spots that are way lighter or darker, you have a dip or hill. If you have a dip or hill, you should invest in a deskmat or hardmat.
## Gliders
The better care you take of your mousepad, the better care you take of your gliders. The only wear on gliders is from particles and fibers scraping against them, increasing drag and decreasing lifetime.  

If you notice any particles on your gliders, run a fingernail across them to remove them, same as you would for a bee stinger. Do NOT use cleaning products or water on the gliders, they are held in place by adhesive, which is degraded with cleaning chemicals.
