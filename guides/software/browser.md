# Browser
Internet browsers are how you use the internet to interact with other computers. Browsers in this day and age are very powerful, and should be treated with respect and care. For windows you basically have 2 choices; chromium based and gecko based.

Chromium based browsers include; Chrome, Edge, Brave, Torch, Vivaldi, and Comodo Dragon.

Gecko based browsers include; Firefox, Comodo Icedragon, and Pale Moon.
## Recommendations
My personal recommendation for any user is Brave. Brand new to computers, a veteran, or an infosec turbo nerd. Brave hands down has the best plug and play experience, needing no extra plugins or extensions to be useable and secure. Having a built in cross site cookie blocker and adblocker, built in torrent client, built in tor browser, and a built in crypto wallet.

It has the best import feature of any browser I have ever used, has more security options, and offers free money just by using it. To put it shortly, Brave offers a crypto currency in reward for seeing extremely non intrusive advertising, you can turn this off if you want.

Some of the features of brave may seem extra, and you wont ever use them, which is why they let you turn them off. Unlike some other browsers (the ones that take up the most of the market share) the features you dont want, can be turned off, and wont ask you to turn them back on.

The user experience of Brave is also pretty good, being based on chromium means customization is easy. You can directly install extensions from the chrome store, the same as you would on any other chromium browser.

The speed is unrivaled compared to other browsers, opening local pages is instant, on webpages you are only limited by your download speed. Not only are they by far the fastest to load and display content, the memory management is years ahead of firefox or edge. You can have literally hundreds of tabs open in brave without experiencing chugging, like you would on chrome after just a few dozen.
## Why chrome is bad
The chromium engine and chrome are two different things. Chromium is an open source base for browers to build upon, while crome is googles closed source version of chromium. For chrome to be useable from download you have to install extensions, if only uBlock Origin, they dont offer anything of the sort because they make money from showing the advertisements, and show their own too.

Chrome offers way less in security, privacy, or general use. Its way slower than brave, uses way more memory, is constantly sending data back and forth from google, and makes the user the product.

If for no other reason than speed and data usage, switch to brave.
## Extensions
Ublock Origin is the best ad and script blocker, thats just how it is. This is beacuse of the extreme customizability, and how often the lists are updated. Using Ublock Origin I have not seen an advertisement on a web browser literally in years. They offer chromium and gecko for those of you who think hating brave is cool.
