# Project Iridium
Project Iridium windows experience and performance optimizer
<h2>Overview</h2>
Project Iridium is my personal attempt at creating a better windows experience for everyone.
<br>
The end goal of Iridium is to have a single installer that when run, will ask a few simple questions, then get started removing the bullshit.  

Replacing drivers, changing settings, removing programs and replacing them with a homemade program suite, configuring per options chosen by the user, altering the registry, installing a custom antivirus, process manager, latency reducer, and system stability improver.
<h2>Why?</h2>
I dislike the practices that microsoft has had in place, and continues to uphold with buisiness partners and customers. They have created an operating system, that as a result of propaganda has significantly more support for software as opposed to mac or linux. I also dislike the practices of certain softwares and peoples in the windows optimization sector of the internet; hiding features behind a paywall, being toxic towards people who dont understand, or asking for money to optimize your computer.  

The original goal in optimization was always to optimize, but also as a way to protect yourself and others from the spyware built inside of windows itself. The current practices of most do not promote these values, they focus on using their experience to generate a revenue, instead of trying to help the most people as possible.  

My goal is to help the most people as possible, in the most effective and efficient way possible. Not only is this a personal project to gain experience and make my windows experience better, but its a project dedicated to those who dont know any better, and have fallen into the trap of misinformation touted about by microsoft. Helping people not only reduces the artifical power microsoft holds on the people, but it also creates a space of learning for people to ask questions, find the answers, and maybe gain some practical experience at the same time.
<h2>Timeline</h2>
Currently I am working daily on learning C to create the program suite and the other pieces of Iridium.  

I do not currently have a known time for anything, but do know that I am working on this daily.  

The current schedule goes as follows:  

Installer infrastructure > settings management > registry management > driver management > antivirus > latency reducer > stability improver > process manager > program suite > custom drivers > custom browser
<h2>What I have for you right now</h2>
Nothing of my own. Before starting on software developement I will be creating a list of softwares and how to use them, along with; general computer use, guides on overclocking, latency reduction, general best practices, internet saftey, internet etiquette, and a devlog of everything I do towards Iridium.
